# Road_Safety Analysis

## Project Title - Analysis of Road Crashes in South Australia from 2012 to 2021

In this project we look into the history of crashes that took place over the period from 2012 to 2021 in South Australia and create a Data Model to predict whether a crash would be fatal or non-fatal.

## Sources of Data


We are using data from the South Australian Government Data Directory:
https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/road-crash-data/resource/1057e9ae-4672-4123-9c1d-1877483da401 and using the csv files from 2012_DATA_SA_Crash to 2021_DATA_SA_Crash

### Modifications
The csv files were combined to get a larger data set to ensure accuracy of the Data Model exceeds 75%.

## Output Data out of this analysis

1. The number, types of crashes and if weather or time of day affects the type or number of crashes
2. The areas showing the highest number of crashes
3. The trend of the crashes over the years 2012 to 2021

## Contents of the Folders
1.  Resources: data sets of the crashes 
2.  Images: Images related to readme files
3.  Project_4_Presentation: Presentation file
